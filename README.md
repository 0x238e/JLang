PolyLLVM
========

PolyLLVM adds an LLVM back end to the [Polyglot](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/polyglot/) compiler, translating Java ASTs into LLVM IR.

Since Polyglot translates extended Java code into vanilla Java ASTs, PolyLLVM should be interoperable with other Polyglot extensions by default. However, it also aims to be extensible itself, so that one can write optimized LLVM translations for language extensions when needed.

A user manual and developer guide can be found on the PolyLLVM [website](http://dbd64.github.io/PolyLLVM/).
