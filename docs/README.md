Making changes to the website
-----------------------------

Documentation is translated from Markdown to HTML using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which is well integrated with Github. To make changes to the website, simply edit a Markdown file and push to master. To preview local changes, install Jekyll and type `jekyll serve`.
